Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is an evolution in the thinking behind TestDrivenDevelopment and AcceptanceTestDrivenPlanning. 

It brings together strands from TestDrivenDevelopment and DomainDrivenDesign into an integrated whole, making the relationship between these two powerful approaches to software development more evident.

The BDD cycle with Rails is the same Outside-In process you’d use with  any other framework (or no framework), web, desktop, command line, or even an API. The cycle depicted in Figure 17.1, on the following page
is the same cycle depicted in Figure 1.1, on page 19, but we’ve added some detail to help you map it to Rails.

    • Start with a scenario. Make sure you have a clear understanding  of the scenario and how it is expected to work, including how the UI should support a user interacting with the app (see the sidebar

    • Drive out the view implementation using the red/green/refactor  cycle with RSpec. You’ll discover any assigned instance variables,
